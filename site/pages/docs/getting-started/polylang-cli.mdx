# `Polylang` CLI

This assumes that you have cloned the repository locally, and built it as described in the [Building Polylang](/docs/getting-started/building-from-source) section.

Suppose we have a contract representing an account: 

```typescript
@public
contract Account {
    id: string;
    name: string;

    setName(newName: string) {
        this.name = newName;
    }
}
```

Suppose we have a sample record like so:

```json
{
    "id": "id1",
    "name": "John"
}
```

We wish to change the value of the `name` field from "John" to "Tom" by invoking the `setName` function defined in the contract.

We can compile and run this contract using the `Polylang` CLI as explained next:

```bash
 $ cargo run --bin compile -- contract:Account function:setName <<< '@public contract Account { id: string; name: string; function setName(newName: string) { this.name = newName; } }' \
  | cargo run -p miden-run -- \
    --this-json '{ "id": "id1", "name": "John" }' \
    --advice-tape-json '["Tom"]'
```

A brief explanation of the command:
    * We compile the contract passing in the contract name (using the `contract:` marker) and the function of interest (using the `function:` marker) as well as the body of the contract itself.
    * The compilation step produces bytecode for the Miden VM as well as a `Polylang` specific ABI JSON text representing the processed contract.
    * We then pipe the output from the compilation step to the `miden-run` executable by passing in:
      1. the record input using the `--this-json` flag. In this case, it's a contract record containing two fields: `id` and `name`.
      2. the new value for the `name` field using the `--advice-json` flag.

This produces:

```bash
<extraneous output redacted>
this_json: {"id":"id1","name":"Tom"}
```

As we can see, the record has been updated, reflecting the name change:

```json
{
    "id": "id1",
    "name": "Tom"
}
```
