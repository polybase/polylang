# Building `Polylang` from Source

`Polylang` can be built as a Rust (library) crate, and used via a client written in Rust.

First, clone the `Polylang` repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/polybase/polylang
```

Then build the project (use `--release` to generate a release build):

```bash
$ cd polylang/
$ cargo build
```

`Polylang` generates both static and dynamic libraries, as can be seen from its `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["staticlib", "cdylib", "rlib"]
```

## Sample Usage 

We can use `Polylang` via its CLI interface, or using it as a library dependency. Each is demonstrated in the following sections.
