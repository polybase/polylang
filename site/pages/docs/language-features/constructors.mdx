# Constructors

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

A constructor is a special `Polylang` function which is used to create a new record of a contract. For the specific signature of the constructor, 
refer to the [simplified grammar](general-structure).

For example, suppose we have the following contract:

```typescript
contract Person {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    age: number;

    constructor (id: string, name; string, age: number) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

The constructor in this case has the following fields: `id`, `name`, and `age`, which map to the fields of the contract. When a new record of the `Person` contract is created,
the constructor is invoked, passed these values, and the fields for this record are updated with these values.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Note that the constructor arguments are not required to match the field names.
</Callout>

The constructor can take fewer arguments than the number of fields in the contract:

```typescript
contract Person {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    age: number;

    constructor (id: string, name; string) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.age = 0; // initialize explicitly
    }
}
```
