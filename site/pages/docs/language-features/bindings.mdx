# Local Variable Bindings

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

`Polylang` allows bindings for variables inside functions using the `let` construct.
The syntax is similar to that of `TypeScript` (or `Rust`):

```typescript
`let` <variable name> `=` <initial value>
```

Each binding must have an initial value assigned to it. Unitialized bindings are not allowed in `Polylang`. Types are automatically inferred using Type Inference.

    You cannot currently provide explicit types. This will be possible soon.

Example:

```typescript
contract Person {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    age: number;

    constructor (id: string, name: string, age: number) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // increment the age by the given value
    incrementAgeBy(inc: number) {
      // bind the variable `oldAge` to the current value of `age` for this record
      let oldAge = this.age;
      // bind `newAge` to the old age increment by `inc`
      let newAge = oldAge + inc;
      // update the `age` field
      this.age = newAge;
   }
}
```

Here we have a function `incrementAgeBy` which takes an increment value `inc`, and updates the `age` field of the record by that increment value. To be able to reference the old value of `age`, we create a couple of 
local binding called `oldAge` and `newAge`.
