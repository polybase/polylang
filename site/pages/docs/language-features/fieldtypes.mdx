# Field Types

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

`Polylang` provides support for the following types.

## Primitive types

    - `string`: a string of UTF-8 characters.
    - `number`: a numerical floating-point value (this type is used for both integral and floating-point values).
    -  sized numeric types:
        * i32 - 32-bit signed integer
        * u32 - 32-bit unsigned integer
        * i64 - 64-bit signed integer
        * u64 - 64-bit unsigned integer
        * f32 - IEEE-754 [single-precision floating-point format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format)
        * f32 - IEEE-754 [double-precision floating-point format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format)
    - `boolean`: a boolean value (`true` and `false`).
    - `bytes`: arbitrary bytes.

Example:

```typescript
contract Person {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    age: number;
    salary: u32;
    qualified: boolean;
    profileImage: bytes;
 }
```

## PublicKey

This is a special type used to represent a public key. Currently, only `secp256k1` (Ethereum) public keys are supported. However, support for [Falcon](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1041.pdf)
public keys is in progress.

This key is used in contracts to enforce a means of [Access Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control) in `Polybase`.

Example:

```typescript
contract User {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    publicKey: PublicKey;

    constructor (id: string, name: string) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.publicKey = ctx.publicKey;
    }

    function setName(newName: string) {
        if (ctx.publicKey != this.publicKey) {
            error('Unauthorized access!)
        }
    }
 }
```

For the `ctx.publicKey` part, please refer to the page on [Context](context).

Later, in the `setName` function (also note the use of the optional `function` keyword), we can check the public key of the user invoking the function against the public key which was used 
at record creation time, and allow the operation only if they match. 

This check provides fine-grained checks over data updates. See the section on [permissions](permissions) for more details on permissions.

## Contract Types

A contract type is simply a reference to a `Polybase` contract. Consider the following example:

```typescript
contract Employee {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    empId: number;
    company: Company;

    constructor (id: string, name: string, empId: number, company: Company) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.empid = empId;
        this.company = company;
    }
}
```

The `company` field if of type `Company`, which is a contract declared as follows:

```typescript
contract Company {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    code: string;

    constructor (id: string, name: string, code: string) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.code = code;
    }
}
```

## Array Types

An array in `Polylang` represents an ordered sequence of values of the same type (homogenous arrays). However, there are some restrictions on which types are allowed
in array declarations. Only the following `Polylang` types are permitted:

    * [Primitive Types](#primitive-types) 
    * [PublicKey](#publickey), and
    * [Contracts](#contract-types)

Example:

```typescript
contract Bank {
    id: string;
    accId: string;
    accounts: Account[];

    ...
  }

contract Account {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    balance: number;

    ...
 }
```


## Map Types

A map in `Polylang` represents, as expected, a mapping from the key type to the value type. However, the key can only be either a `string` or a `number` while the value can be any
valid `Polylang` type.

Example:

```typescript
contract Bank {
    id: string;
    accId: string;
    accounts: map<string, Account>;

    ...
  }

contract Account {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    balance: number;

    ...
}

```

## Object Types

As in the case of [nested fields](fields/#nested-fields), an object type represents a composite contract of key-value pairs.

Example:

```typescript
contract Product {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    price: number;
    tags: string[];
    details: {
        description: string;
        manufacturer: string;
    }

    constructor (id: string, name: string, price: number, description: string, manufacturer: string) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
        this.details = {
            description: description,
            manufacturer: manufacturer
        }
    }
}
```

In the example above, the `details` field is of object type, and in the constructor, we populate this field by populating its nested fields with the values from the constructor arguments.
