# Control Flow

`Polylang` provides the typical control flow constructs found in most programming languages. 

## Conditional branching

Conditional branching is provided by the `if-else` construct. The `else` part is optional.

A simple example:

```typescript
@public
contract Person {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    age: number;
    canVote: boolean;

    constructor (id: string, name: string, age: number) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    checkVotingCapability() {
        if (this.age >= 18) {
            this.canVote = true;
        } else {
            error('you have a long wait ahead of you!');
        }
    }
}
```

Note that we cannot chain `if-else`. For instance, the following code is **not** valid:

```typescript
@public
contract Person {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    age: number;
    canVote: boolean;

    constructor (id: string, name: string, age: number) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.canVote = false;
    }

    checkVotingCapability() {
        if (this.age >= 18) {
            this.canVote = true;
        } else if (this.age >= 12) { // this is not allowed
            throw error('wait a few more years!');
        } else {
           throw error('you have a long wait ahead of you!');
        }
    }
} 
```

Instead, what you can do is to nest them like so:


```typescript
@public
contract Person {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    age: number;
    canVote: boolean;

    constructor (id: string, name: string, age: number) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.canVote = false;
    }

    checkVotingCapability() {
        if (this.age >= 18) {
            this.canVote = true;
        } else {
            // this is allowed
            if (this.age >= 12) { 
                throw error('wait a few more years!');
            } else {
                throw error('you have a long wait ahead of you!');
             }
        }
    }
} 
```


## Loops

`Polylang` has two looping constructs - `for` and `while`. These are similar to their analogs in C-like language.

### for

We also have `TypeScript` like `for` loops. See the `incrementAgeMagically` function below:

```typescript
@public
contract Person {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    age: number;

    constructor (id: string, name: string, age: number) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // increment the age the given number of times
    incrementAgeMagically(times: number) {
        for (let i = 0; i < times; i += 1) {
            this.age += 1;
        }
    }
} 
```

## while

The `while` loop again functions like the `while` loop in C-like languages:

```typescript
@public
contract Person {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    age: number;
    canVote: boolean;

    constructor (id: string, name: string, age: number) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.canVote = false;
    }

    checkVotingCapability() {
        if (this.age >= 18) {
            this.canVote = true;
        } else {
            // this is allowed
            if (this.age >= 12) { 
                throw error('wait a few more years!');
            } else {
                throw error('you have a long wait ahead of you!');
             }
        }
    }

    // increment the age by the given value
    incrementAgeMagically(inc: number) {
      let oldAge = this.age;
       while (this.age < oldAge + inc) {
         this.age += 1;
       }  
    }
}
```
Note the local binding produced:`let oldAge = this.age;` inside the `incrementAgeMagically` function.
