# Lexical Structure

## Comments

`Polylang` supports both singl-line comments using `//` extending to the end of the line:

```typescript
@public
contract Computer {
    id: string;
    // the model for this computer
    model: string;

    // create an instance of the `Computer` contract
    constructor (id: string, model: string) {
        this.id = id;
        this.model = model;
    }
 }
```

as well as multi-line comments using `/* ... */`:

```typescript
@public
contract Computer {
    id: string;
    // the model for this computer
    model: string;

    // create an instance of the `Computer` contract
    constructor (id: string, model: string) {
        this.id = id;
        this.model = model;
    }

    /*
        Update the model for this particulat computer.
        Changes the value of the `model` field.
    */
    setModel(newModel: string) {
        this.model = newModel;
    }
 }
```

## Identifiers

An identifier is an unlimited-length sequence of letters and digits, the first of which must be a letter (or underscore). Identifiers are used for naming contracts, fields, and functions.
Identifiers may not be a [reserved word](#reserved-words).

## Literals

`Polylang` supports the following literal types:
    * String literals - a sequence of Unicode (`UTF-8`) characters. Eg: `"Hello, мир"`.
    * Numeric literals:
       - the `number` type supports both integral and decimal values. Eg: `42`, `-12.3849`. This is like the `number` type in `JavaScript`/`TypeScript`.
       - the named integral and decimal types support more restricted values. Eg:
        * i32 - 32-bit signed integers such as `42`, `-2356`.
        * u32 - 32-bit unsigned integers such as `0`, `21`.
    * Boolean literals - `true` and `false`.

## Operators

`Polylang` supports the usual arithmetic, relational, assignment, and boolean operators:
    * `*`, `/`, `%`, `+`, `-`
    * `-=`, `+=`
    * `&`, `**`, `&&`, `^`, `|`, `||`, `<=`, `>=`, `=`, `==`, `!=`, 

## Reserved Words

The following are reserved for use as keywords, and cannot be used as identifiers in `Polylang` (contract names, field names, function/method names etc.):
    * `true`, `false`
    * `number`, `f32`, `f64`, `u32`, `u64`, `i32`, `i64`
    * `string`
    * `boolean`
    * `map`
    * `record`
    * `let`
    * `break`, `return`, `throw`
    * `if`, `else`
    * `while`, `for`
    * `in`, `of`
    * `function`
    * `collection`
    * `contract`
    * `PublicKey`
    * `bytes`
