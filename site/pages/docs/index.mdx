# Introducing Polylang
 
 ## What is Polylang?

`Polylang` is a statically (and strongly typed) smart contract programming language, with syntax and features influenced by languages such as `JavaScript` and `TypeScript`, used by [Polybase](https://polybase.xyz/) for writing smart contracts[^1] 
whereby proofs can be generated that state transitions follow the contract's rules, and which compiles down to [Zero-Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) programs that are verified using zk-STARKs.

Zero-Knowledge provides two main benefits:
    * Provable computation - proves that the code ran as designed, and therefore the output can be trusted.
    * Privacy - the user can prove that they possess certain information without revealing the information itself.

Refer to the page on [Zero-Knowledge](/docs/zk-proofs/what-is-zk) for more details.

## Overview

Using `Polylang`, you can define contract fields, and add methods (functions associated with the contract) that operate on the data (fields).

An example of a typical smart contract in `Polylang` is:

```typescript
contract Person {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    age: number;

    // create a new record for this smart contract
    constructor (id: string, name: string, age: number) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // update the name for this record
    setName(newName: string) {
        this.name = newName;
    }

    // update the age for this record
    setAge(newAge: number) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

The code above defines a smart contract called `Person` which defines a set of fields associated with `Person`. In this case, we have three fields: 
    * the `id` field which uniquely identifies a "record" of this contract
    * a `name` field for storing the name of the person 
    * an `age` field for storing the age of the person

Like other smart contract languages, `Polylang` allows the updating of a contract's state by calling functions/methods on the contract.
In the contract above, we have defined a couple of functions that can update the `name` and `age` fields of the contract.

## Using Polylang

`Polylang` is open-source and implemented in Rust. It can be used as a CLI or as a library (crate). Head to the next section to get started with `Polylang`.
